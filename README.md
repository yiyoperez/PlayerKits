# PlayerKits
 Ajneb's plugin page at [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/playerkits-fully-configurable-kits-1-8-1-17.75185/), and [original source](https://github.com/Ajneb97/PlayerKits).

## Fork
My intention with this fork is NOT to maintain the plugin, it's just a version that I could use in my own testing server environment.

I could probably accept some feature & pull requests, I'm also looking to fix errors so issues section is available.
